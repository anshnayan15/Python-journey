# My Python Journey

Welcome to my repository! ðŸš€

I am passionate about **cricket** and **cricket analysis**, and Iâ€™m using this journey to combine my love for the game with my learning in **data analysis** via Python. Through this repository, I aim to dive deep into the world of cricket using data to understand the game from a more analytical perspective.

This repository will contain my journey, learning resources, and code that I develop while exploring **data analysis techniques** applied to cricket-related data. Whether it's player statistics, match analysis, or team performance, I'll be using Python to gain insights into various aspects of the game.

Feel free to explore the code, contribute, or suggest improvements as I continue to grow and learn.
